# Input / Output
## Output
```java
System.out.println(value);
```
This statement will print whatever `value` is and start a new line.

```java
System.out.print(value);
```

This statement will print `value` without starting a new line.

## Input
For input, we'll have to use a new data type called `Scanner`.

To use `Scanner`, you need to *import* it, so that the Java compiler knows what `Scanner` is. To do this, put an import statement at the top of your code, like so:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

You need to first create a `Scanner`.
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

To read a `String`, use the `nextLine` method.

```java
sc.nextLine()
```
is an expression that will evaluate to whatever the user types in.

If you want a `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, or `boolean`, use `nextByte`, `nextShort`, `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextFloat`, `nextDouble`, and `nextBoolean` instead of `nextLine`.
