# Setup & Basics
Set up your Java program like this. Make sure it's in a file called `Main.java`.

```java
class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// set of statements here
	}
}
```

This will be explained later, but for now, just know that this is what you have to write.

## Compiler
A compiler is a program that takes in code in a human-readable programming language (e.g. Java) and spits out machine code that is readable by a computer.

## Basic Concepts
### Statements
A *statement* is an area of code that represents an instruction. Each statement must end in a semicolon (`;`). Statements are executed sequentially.

### Values
A *value* represents some data.

### Expressions
An *expression* is the area of code that when run, represents some value. We would say that that expression *evaluates* to that value.
