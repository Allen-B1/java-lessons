# Variables
A *variable* is a storage location, like a box that has both a label on it (variable name) and something inside of it (value).

A variable name can only consist of underscores (_), uppercase and lowercase letters, and digits (0-9) and cannot start with a digit.

Before you can use a variable, you must first state that it exists. To do that, you use a type of statement called a *variable declaration*, which looks like this:

```
typeName variableName;
```
where *typeName* should be replaced by the data type that will go inside a variable, and *variableName* should be replaced by the name of the variable.

For example, the statements
```java
String word;
int age;
```
create two variables, one called `word` which can (only) hold `String`s, and one called `age` which can (only) hold `int`s.

```plaintext
+-------+ +-----+
| null  | |  0  |
+-------+ +-----+
  word      age
```

To change what's inside the metaphorical box, you need to *assign* the variable to something.

```java
variableName = expression;
```

For example,
```java
word = "hello";
age = 5;
```

```plaintext
+-------+ +-----+
|"hello"| |  5  |
+-------+ +-----+
  word      age
```

It's possible to declare and assign to a variable in the same statement.

```java
String favoriteBook = "Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe";
```

### `final` variables
`final` variables can only be assigned to once.

A `final` variable declaration is a normal variable declaration with the addition of `final` in front.

```java
final typeName variableName;
// OR
final typeName variableName = expression;
```

An example.

```java
final int PAPER_HEIGHT = 11;
PAPER_HEIGHT = 12; // error! second assignment
```
