# Variables & Constants

### Variables
Think of variables like boxes. Each box has a label, as well as something inside of it.

To make a variable, type
```
typeName variableName;
```
where *typeName* should be replaced by a type, and *variableName* should be replaced by the name of the variable. This kind of statement is called a variable *declaration*.

For example, the statements
```java
String word;
int age;
```
create two variables (boxes), one called `word` which can hold `String`s, and one called `age` which can hold `int`s.

```
+-------+ +-----+
| null  | |  0  |
+-------+ +-----+
  word      age
```

To put something into the variables, you need to *assign* it to something. This process is called *assignment*.

```java
word = "hello";
age = 5;
```

```
+-------+ +-----+
|"hello"| |  5  |
+-------+ +-----+
  word      age
```

It's possible to declare and assign to a variable in the same statement.

```java
String favoriteBook = "Ari & Dante";
```

### Constants
Constants, or final variables, are variables that are constant. Going back to the box analogy, you can't replace what's already inside the box.

A constant must be declared and assigned to in the same statement. The syntax is
```java
final typeName variableName = value;
```

Example:
```java
final int PAPER_HEIGHT = 11;
```
