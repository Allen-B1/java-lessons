# Type Conversions
## Truncation
When a floating-point type is converted to an integer type, the value is rounded down.

## Type Casts
Type casts allow you to convert values from one type to another type.

```java
(newType)oldValue
```

```java
double grade = 89.9;
System.out.println(grade);      // 89.9
System.out.println((int)grade); // 89
```

## Implicit Conversions
In certain cases, values will automatically be converted to a different type. For example, when the `+` operator is used with one operand being a `String` and the
other operand being another type, the latter will be converted to a `String`.
