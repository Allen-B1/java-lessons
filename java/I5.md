# Input / Output
## Output
`System.out.println` will print a value and start a new line.

```java
System.out.println(value);
```

`System.out.print` will print a value without starting a new line.

```java
System.out.print(value);
```

## Input
For input, we'll have to use a new data type called `Scanner`.

To use `Scanner`, you need to *import* it, so that the Java compiler knows what `Scanner` is. To do this, put an import statement at the top of your code.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

A variable of type `Scanner` must be declared first and assigned to the `new Scanner(System.in)`.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

To actually retrieve a `String` from the user, use `sc.nextLine()`. That expression that will ask the user for input then evaluate to whatever the user types in.

```java
String s = sc.nextLine();
byte i1 = sc.nextByte();
short i2 = sc.nextShort();
int i3 = sc.nextInt();
float f1 = sc.nextFloat(); 
double f2 = sc.nextDouble();
```

If you want a `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, or `boolean`, use `nextByte`, `nextShort`, `nextInt`, `nextLong`, `nextFloat`, `nextDouble`, and `nextBoolean` instead of `nextLine`.

# Exercise
Ask the user for their name.
Store it into a variable.
Print out their name.
