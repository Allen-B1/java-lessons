# Data Types
A *data type* is a property of a *value* that describes what kind of data that value represents.

## Numbers
### Integers
`byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long` values all represent integers.

Each type can only represent integers within a certain range.

| Type | Range | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `byte` | [-2^7^, 2^7^-1] | 1 byte = 8 bits |
| `short` | [-2^15^, 2^15^-1] | 2 bytes = 16 bits |
| `int` | [-2^31^, 2^31^-1] | 4 bytes = 32 bits |
| `long` | [-2^63^, 2^63^-1] | 8 bytes = 64 bits |

Use `int` unless there's a reason not to, as they're efficient to work with on most modern architectures.

### Floating-Point Types
`double` and `float` both represent real numbers. `double` is more precise than `float`.

Use `double` unless there's a reason to use `float`.

[More information about floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) if you're curious. (`float` is single-precision; `double` is double-precision).

## Text
`char` represents one character, like `'A'`, `'x'`, or `'å¥½'`.

`String` represents a sequence of characters (or text), for instance `"Hello world"`.

`String` literals are enclosed by double quotes ("), while `char` literals are enclosed by single quotes (').

## Boolean
A `boolean` can either be `true` or `false`.

Fun Fact: Booleans are named after George Boole, a mathematician who contributed significantly to the field of algebraic logic.

## `void`
The `void` is a special type that represents nothing.

## Summary
| Type | Represents |
|---|---|
| `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` | Integer |
| `float`, `double` | Real Number |
| `char` | Character |
| `String` | Text |
| `boolean` | Boolean |
| `void` | Nothing |
