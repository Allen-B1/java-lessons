# `for` Loops
The `for` loop is a fancy form of the `while` loop. Like the `while` loop, it also supports `break` and `continue` statements.

```java
for (initialization; condition; postcondition) {
	// body
}
```

`condition` is a `boolean` expression. `initialization` and `postcondition` are statements.

```mermaid
graph TD
init[initialization] --> cond{condition}
cond --> |true| body
body --> post[postcondition]
post --> cond
cond --> |false| next("next statement")
body --> |break| next
body --> |continue| post
```
