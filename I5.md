# Operators
Operators allow you to combine multiple values (the *operands*) into one value (the *result*).

## Numeric
All numeric operators that take two operands must have operands that have the same type.

### Arithmetic
| Name | Expression | Result |
|---|---|---|
| addition | `a + b` | sum of `a` + `b` |
| subtraction | `a - b` | difference of `a` - `b` |
| multiplication | `a * b` | product of `a` x `b` |
| division | `a / b` | quotient of `a` ÷ `b` |
| modulus | `a % b` | remainder of `a` ÷ `b` |
| negation | `-a` | additive inverse of `a` |
| unary plus | `+a` | `a` |

### Bitwise & Bitshifts
These aren't as commonly used, but they're listed here for the sake of completion.

[More information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operator), if you're curious.

| Name | Expression |
|---|---|
| bitwise and | `a & b` |
| bitwise or | `a | b` |
| bitwise xor | `a ^ b` |
| bitwise not | `~a` |
| left bitshift| `a << b` |
| sign-extending right bitshift | `a >> b` |
| zero-extending right bitshift | `a >>> b` |

## Comparison
These operators also take two operands (`a` and `b`) that have the same type and give a result that is a `boolean`.

| Expression | Result |
|---|---|
| `a == b` | `true` if `a` = `b` |
| `a != b` | `true` if `a` ≠ `b` |
| `a < b` | `true` if `a` < `b` |
| `a > b` | `true` if `a` > `b` |
| `a <= b` | `true` if `a` ≤ `b` |
| `a >= b` | `true` if `a` ≥ `b` |

## Conditional
These operators take two `boolean` operators and result in a `boolean`.

| Name | Expression | Result |
|---|---|---|
| and | `a && b` | `true` if `a` and `b` are `true` |
| or | `a || b` | `true` if `a` or `b` (or both) is `true` |
| not | `!a` | `true` if `a` is `false` and `false` if `a` is `true` |

## Ternary
`a ? b : c` results in `b` if `a` is `true`, otherwise `c`.

`a` must be a `boolean`. `b` and `c` must have the same type.

## Concatenation
`a + b` can also be used on `String`s. It results in `a`, followed by `b`. For example, 
```java
"Hello" + "World"
```
would result in 
```java
"HelloWorld"
```
